# Tau Parser {#mainpage}

Tau Parser is  a industry-level C++ parsing library and parser generator, capable of taking any context free grammar and an input string, and producing the full parse forest, capturing all ambiguities efficiently.
  
This library additionally provides a parser for TGF (Tau Grammar Format), an EBNF-like language for describing boolean grammars, and a `tgf` tool. The tool takes a grammar described in a TGF file and it can help to debug the grammar or generate C++ code of the parser.
