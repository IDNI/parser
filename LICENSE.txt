§ 2 Grant of license.  For usage of the Product that is permitted for free, IDNI AG grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license without fees to install, execute, and use the Product.  
The Product is licensed, not sold.
IDNI AG reserves all rights not expressly granted in this license.


§ 3 Contributions to the Tau Parsing Library.  You are entitled to propose new code, documentation, or any other materials ("Contribution"), via the public code repositories of the Product. In such cases, you transfer to IDNI AG all rights, title, and interest associated with the Contribution. Such contributed materials are subject to this license agreement as if they were produced by IDNI AG.


§ 4 Termination. The Agreement is effective from the time you access the Product and remains effective until terminated. Your rights under this Agreement terminate immediately without notice from IDNI AG if you materially breach any terms of this agreement or take any action against IDNI AG’s rights to the Product.  IDNI AG may terminate this Agreement immediately should any part of the Product become the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade secret misappropriation. IDNI AG declares that it is not aware of any such infringement or misappropriation. You can terminate this agreement at any time for any reason.  Upon termination, you will cease use of and destroy all copies of the Product under your control and confirm compliance in writing to IDNI AG. Neither termination of this Agreement nor any deletion or removal of the Product shall limit any obligations you may have to IDNI AG, or any rights and/or remedies that IDNI AG may have with respect to any past or future infringing use of the Product (including, but not limited to, any use of the Product outside the scope of the license provided in this Agreement).  Upon termination of this agreement, all provisions relating to retention of all rights by IDNI AG, indemnifications, disclaimers, definitions, and all of your limits, restrictions, and obligations under this agreement, continue to apply. 


§ 5 Disclaimer of Warranty.  IDNI AG provides the Product “as is,” without warranty of any kind, either express or implied.  IDNI AG specifically disclaims any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.  You assume the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Product.  If the Product is defective in any way, you assume all resulting costs including servicing, repair, or correction.


§ 6 Limitation of Liability. In no event will IDNI AG or any personnel associated with IDNI AG be liable for any lost revenue, profit, data, or data use, or for special, indirect, consequential, incidental, or punitive damages, regardless of the cause of loss or theory of liability, arising out of or related to the use of or inability to use the Product.  In no event will IDNI AG or any personnel associated with IDNI AG be liable for third party claims based on your use of the Product.  You agree to indemnify IDNI AG and personnel associated with IDNI AG for any claims brought by third parties arising from your use of the Product.  In no event will IDNI AG’s liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the USD value of the payment by you for the Product at the time of payment. 


§ 7 Separately Licensed Third Party Technology.  The Product may contain or require the use of third party technology that is provided with the Product.  IDNI AG may provide certain notices to you in the Product’s documentation, readmes or notice files in connection with such third party technology.  Third party technology will be licensed to you either under the terms of this Agreement or, if specified in the documentation, readmes, or notice files, under Separate Terms.  Your rights to use Separately Licensed Third Party Technology under Separate Terms are not restricted in any way by this Agreement.  However, third party technology that is not Separately Licensed Third Party Technology shall be deemed part of the Product and is licensed to you under the terms of this Agreement. “Separate Terms” refers to separate license terms that are specified in the Product’s documentation, readmes, or notice files, and that apply to Separately Licensed Third Party Technology. “Separately Licensed Third Party Technology” refers to third party technology that is licensed under Separate Terms and not under the terms of this Agreement.

You agree that no data, information, and/or Product (or direct product thereof) will be exported, directly or indirectly, in violation of these Rules, or will be used for any purpose prohibited by these Rules including, without limitation, nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons proliferation, or development of missile technology.  To the extent that any of the Rules prohibits granting a license to you, no license is granted.


§ 9 Government End Users.  For any end user using the Product on behalf of a governmental entity, the Product is “commercial computer software” pursuant to relevant applicable regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation and agency-specific supplemental regulations for the U.S. government.

No other rights are granted to the governmental entity.


§ 10 Miscellaneous. This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and IDNI AG relating to its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this Agreement will immediately terminate.  This Agreement is governed by the laws of Liechtenstein, and you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue in, the courts of Liechtenstein in any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement.
