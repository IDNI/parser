# The Tau Parsing Library

The Tau parsing library is a high-performance, industrial-strength, continuously maintained parsing tool. It is a C++ library able to parse, and generate a parser to, any Context Free Grammar (CFG) and even all Boolean grammars. 

Compared to existing parsing solutions, the Tau Parsing Library stands out with it simplicity and robustness: just give it a grammar and an input string, and it will give you a representation of all possible parse trees, without any need for additional information, configuration, or callbacks that other CFG parsers commonly require you to provide.


# Generate a parser in 3 easy steps:

First, define the grammar using the Tau Grammar Format (TGF), which is very similar to EBNF.

	@use char classes space, digit.  # introduce space and digit native productions

	start => _ expr _.

	expr  =>  ( '(' _ expr _ ')'  ):group
		| ( expr _ '-' _ expr ):sub
		| ( expr _ '+' _ expr ):add
		| ( expr _ '/' _ expr ):div
		| ( expr _ '*' _ expr ):mul
		| ( '+' _ expr        ):pos
		| ( '-' _ expr        ):neg
		| ( digit+            ):number.

	_     => space*.                 # optional white space of any length



Second, use the TGF command line utility to translate your TGF file into a parser header file using just one command.

	tgf basic_arithmetic.tgf gen


Finally, include the parser header file in your C++ program and initialize your parser object. The parser object can then parse any valid input string in your grammar and return a parse forest or a syntax error.

	#include "basic_arithmetic_parser.generated.h"

	int main() {

		std::string input = "-12*5"; // input expression

		// run parser and get a parse result
		basic_arithmetic_parser::result r = basic_arithmetic_parser::instance()
						.parse(input.c_str(), input.size());

		// check if any successfully parsed tree was found
		if (!r.found) {
			std::cerr << r.parse_error << std::endl;
			return 1;
		}

		// get the parse tree from the result and print it to stdout
		r.get_tree()->to_print(std::cout);

		return 0;
	}


Above program prints:

	start(3)[0, 5]
		_(4)[0, 0]
		expr(5)[0, 5]
			mul(12)[0, 5]
				expr(5)[0, 3]
					neg(18)[0, 3]
						'-'[0, 1]
						_(4)[1, 1]
						expr(5)[1, 3]
							number(20)[1, 3]
								digit(2)[1, 2]
									'1'[1, 2]
								digit(2)[2, 3]
									'2'[2, 3]
				_(4)[3, 3]
				'*'[3, 4]
				_(4)[4, 4]
				expr(5)[4, 5]
					number(20)[4, 5]
						digit(2)[4, 5]
							'5'[4, 5]
		_(4)[5, 5]



## Features

- Boolean grammars
- C++ API (docs/programatic_grammar.md)
- [TGF](docs/tgf.md) - Tau Grammar Format for describing grammars in an EBNF-like format
- Earley based parser with garbage collection producing parse forest containing a compressed representation of all the parsed trees

- Forest traversal API with callbacks and extraction of trees and graphs to deal with transformations and with ambiguity
- `tgf` tool to test grammars in TGF file or to generate a C++ code representing a parser for a given TGF file.
- Predefined or custom classes of characters defined by a function (`<cctype>`-like functions)
- Optional [recoding](docs/recoders.md) of an input string into another type which can can be used for lexing, reencoding or accessing binary data
- [own UTF-8 support](docs/utf8.md)



## How to use

To build the library and the `tgf` tool requires CMake and a compiler supporting C++23 with GNU extensions (`-std=gnu++23`).
Then, for Windows with Mingw-w64 you can use `w64-debug.sh` or `w64-release.sh` script, and for Linux there are `debug.sh` and `release.sh` scripts for compiling all source files. After successful compilation you can find the artifacts in `build-Debug` and `build-Release` folders.


### TGF tool

This library comes with a CLI executable `tgf` which features viewing, testing and debugging grammars written in TGF and it can also generate a C++ code from TGF grammar which is then usable in a C++ project.

More detailed information about this CLI can be found on page [`TGF tool`](docs/tgf_tool.md)

TGF is an EBNF-based format to describe grammars. Description of this format can be found on page [`Tau Grammar Format`](docs/tau_grammar_format.md).

## API

### Basic terminology

The following terminology is standard:

**Literal** is either a terminal or a non-terminal.

A **terminal** literal is a fixed single character (from the chosen alphabet).

A **non-terminal** literal represents a syntactic category or a placeholder that can be replaced by a sequence of terminals and/or non-terminals. Non-terminal literals are used to define the structure of the language.

A **production rule** consists of two parts: a left-hand side (LHS) and a right-hand side (RHS). The left-hand side contains a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side contains a sequence of terminals and non-terminals. The production rule indicates that the non-terminal on the left-hand side can be rewritten or expanded into the sequence of symbols on the right-hand side.

**Grammar** is a formal system that defines a set of strings (a language). It consists of terminals, non-terminals, production rules and a starting symbol (which is a non-terminal).

**Conjunctive Grammar** is a grammar which allows usage of conjunctions of literal sequences in production rules. The conjunction acts as a logical "AND" operation, indicating that all the conjuncted literal sequences must be matched for the whole rule to be satisfied.

**Boolean Grammar** is a conjunctive grammar which also allows usage of negation of literal sequences. Negation acts as a logical "NOT" operation, indicating that if the negated literal sequence is matched the whole rule fails to be satisfied.

**DNF** or **Disjunctive Normal form** is a specific form of representing logical formulas, Boolean expressions or production rules in our case. In DNF, a logical formula is represented as a disjunction (OR) of one or more conjunctions (AND) of literals.

**EBNF** or **Extended Backusâ€“Naur form** is a family of metasyntax notations, any of which can be used to express a context-free grammar.

**TGF** or **Tau Grammar Format** is an EBNF based format to describe grammars which are usable by this library. TGF understands EBNF-like syntax (+, *, [] and {}) so it is easier to define repetition or optionality.

### Namespace

The library uses an `idni` namespace for its declarations.

For simplicity, all examples in library documentation expect declaration `using namespace idni;`.

### Templates

Most of the structures provided by this library are templates in order to support arbitrary alphabets (terminals) as well as to generalize the concept of "string". Usually they are declared like this:

`template <typename C = char, typename T = C> ...` where
- `C` is the input type of the input data (usually characters).
- `T` is the type of terminals.

Fully supported and tested types are `char` and `char32_t` (including Unicode). Though it is possible to supply encoder and decoder functions to the parser to convert input elements of any type into terminals of any other type.

If `T` differs from `C` it is required to provide decoder and encoder functions in `parser::options`. `parser` uses these decoders to convert input data into terminals and back. See [recoders](docs/recoders.md) for more information.
