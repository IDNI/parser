# IDNI parser library

This C++ parser generator was created in an effort to facilitate the development of the Tau language. The predecessor to the Tau language was TML and its parser was hand-coded in C++.
As the TML language evolved in complexity, it became increasingly difficult to evolve the C++ parser to include all the language features we wanted to add to TML.
That is why at the beginning of the Tau project, we started by first developing this parser generator based on the Earley parsing algorithm. It afforded us the ability to
effortlessly evolve the syntax of Tau language as we wished without the need to maintain very complex C++ code. We chose the Earley parsing algorithm because it is capable
of parsing any context free language while remaining efficient even in the presence of ambiguities in the grammar.

To make it even easier to define grammars, we created TGF (or the Tau Grammar format), an EBNF-like language for describing boolean grammars and included a `tgf` tool
which takes a grammar described in a TGF file and generates C++ code of the corresponding parser. It can also help debug the grammar.


## Features

- Boolean (including conjunctive) grammars
	- C++ structures with operators for [creating grammars programmatically](docs/programatic_grammar.md)
	- [TGF](docs/tgf.md) - Tau Grammar Form language for describing grammars in an EBNF-like format
- Earley based parser with garbage collection producing parse forest containing all the parsed trees
- scannerless (lexerless) parsing
- forest traversal with callbacks and extraction of trees and graphs to deal with transformations and with ambiguity
- `tgf` tool to test grammars in TGF file or to generate a C++ code representing a parser for a given TGF file.
- predefined or custom classes of characters defined by a function (`<cctype>`-like functions)
- optional [recoding](docs/recoders.md) of an input into another type which can can be used for lexing, reencoding or accessing binary data
- [own UTF-8 support](docs/utf8.md)
- no dependencies on other libraries


## How to use

To use the library or `tgf` tool you first have to compile this project. This requires CMake and a compiler supporting C++23 with GNU extensions (`-std=gnu++23`).

On Windows with Mingw-w64 you can use `w64-debug.sh` or `w64-release.sh` script, and for Linux there are `debug.sh` and `release.sh` scripts for compiling all source files. After successful compilation you can find the artifactis in `build-Debug` and `build-Release` folders.


### TGF tool

This library comes with a CLI executable `tgf` which features viewing, testing and debugging grammars written in TGF and it can also generate a C++ code from TGF grammar which is then usable in a C++ project.

More detailed information about this CLI can be found on page [`TGF tool`](docs/tgf_tool.md)

TGF is an EBNF-based form to describe grammars. Specification of the form can be found on page [`Tau Grammar Form`](docs/tau_grammar_form.md).

### JSON parser

[An example](examples/csv_parser9/main.cpp) of a complete JSON parser that reads a JSON element from a file, traverses the resulting tree and outputs a string representing the original JSON data.

## API

### Basic terminology

**Literal** refers to a specific value or sequence of characters that appears exactly as it is in the input or in the grammar rules. It represents a fixed, concrete element that must be matched in order for a particular rule or pattern to be satisfied.
Literal can be terminal or non-terminal.

A **terminal** literal represents a specific token or value in the input language. It corresponds to the actual elements that appear in the input stream during parsing. Terminal literals are also referred to as terminals or terminal symbols.

A **non-terminal** literal represents a syntactic category or a placeholder that can be replaced by a sequence of terminals and/or non-terminals. Non-terminal literals are used to define the structure of the language and serve as intermediate building blocks for generating valid sentences or expressions.

A **production rule** consists of two parts: a left-hand side (LHS) and a right-hand side (RHS). The left-hand side contains a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side contains a sequence of terminals, non-terminals, or both. The production rule indicates that the non-terminal on the left-hand side can be rewritten or expanded into the sequence of symbols on the right-hand side.

**Grammar** is a formal system that defines the syntax and structure of a language. It consists of terminals, non-terminals, production rules and a starting symbol (which is usually a non-terminal).

**Conjunctive Grammar** is a grammar which allows usage of conjunctions of literal sequences in production rules. The conjunction acts as a logical "AND" operation, indicating that all the conjuncted literal sequences must be matched for the whole rule to be satisfied.

**Boolean Grammar** is a conjunctive grammar which also allows usage of negation of literal sequences. Negation acts as a logical "NOT" operation, indicating that if the negated literal sequence is matched the whole rule fails to be satisfied.

**DNF** or **Disjunctive Normal form** is a specific form of representing logical formulas, Boolean expressions or production rules in our case. In DNF, a logical formula is represented as a disjunction (OR) of one or more conjunctions (AND) of literals.

**EBNF** or **Extended Backusâ€“Naur form** is a family of metasyntax notations, any of which can be used to express a context-free grammar.

**TGF** or **Tau Grammar Form** is an EBNF based form to describe grammars which are usable by this library. TGF understands EBNF syntax (+, *, [] and {}) so it is easier to define repetition or optionality.

### Namespace

Library uses an `idni` namespace for its declarations.

For simplicity, all examples in library documentation expect declaration `using namespace idni;`.

### Templating

Most of the structures provided by this library are templates to enable generic parsing of any input data while parsing any type of terminals. Usually they are declared like this:

`template <typename C = char, typename T = C> ...` where
- `C` is an input type of input data (usually characters).
- `T` is a type of a terminal.

Fully supported and tested types are `char` and `char32_t` (Unicode support). Though it is possible to supply encoder and decoder functions to your parser and these can convert input elements of any type into terminals of any type.

If `T` differs from `C` it is required to provide decoder and encoder functions in `parser::options`. `parser` uses these recoders to convert input data into terminals and back. See [recoders](docs/recoders.md) for more information.
